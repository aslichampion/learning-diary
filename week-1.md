# Week One Diary

## Setup

First week has been full of classic setup awkwardness, been troubleshooitng installing 
Ruby on the three different Macs I have available to me, all of which yeilded different 
results for no apparent reason. If I found that more frustrating that I actually do this 
would probably be the wrong career to be getting into anyway!

## Command Line

Now starting to feel more familiar with the command line than I have previously, I have 
always used it sparingly in my work to troubleshoot macOS, mostly from within single 
user mode or recovery to do one or two specific quick things (usually deleting stubborn 
directories as root or copying data from a damaged OS). But have so far this week set up 
my terminal and customised it, added some custom powerline fonts, and changed the theme 
so it better communicates what is happening in a git repo whilst I'm working.

## Git

Speaking of git, this one was totally new to me, will need a bit of time to unpack 
exactly what the commands all do, but that will be my task for the rest of the day as we 
have been challenged to diagram how git works, I'm going to create a visual map of it 
that includes all the commands as well. Watch this space for how well that goes haha!
