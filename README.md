# Learning Diary

This will be the place for all my restrospective assessment during my bootcamp with 
Makers. Each week I'll reflect on what I've achevied and also what has gone terribly 
wrong!

Hopefully by the end of the course the weighting towards things going well is above 
50%...

## About Me

Apple

**Bio**

I have worked in an Apple retail store for the last 7 years, most recently as a Mac 
technician at the Genius Bar. I've always enjoyed working with technical 
concepts, but my formal education has been in music and music psychology. I'm hoping 
that I can combine the best of my technical knowledge and creative passion within 
the world of software development!
